# R-Nifty-Tricks
A compendium of oft-used, handy tricks to do things in R. 
Through 2018, I have encountered several instances of things I knew could be done in other programming languages, but didn't know how to do them in R. So I put together this repository, with all the tricks I learned. I'll keep adding to this list whenever I find nifty alternatives/performance tuning features in R.

* Measuring the performance of your code
* Running multiple scripts through a Master R Script
* Error Handling using Try-Catch in R
